# Aircraft Finder
C program that with a txt database searches according to parameters the corresponding airplanes.

It is necessary to compile the code in the same folder where you have the file aviones.txt

The file portada.txt is not necessary for the code to work, it is just a decorative extra that mentions the authors. If you want to delete it to avoid getting an error message, just delete lines 21-27 and 264 of the code.
